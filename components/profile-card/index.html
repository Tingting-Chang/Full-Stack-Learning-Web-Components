  <h4>About the Developer</h4>
  <p class="about">
    I am TingtingChang, a Chinese girl who is trying to become an awesome  full stack developer and to make contributions to the female CS world. Right now I am at the tail of my graduate school year. I have been the U.S. for one year half but I am still working on my oral and writing English. So please feel free to correct me when I make mistakes and help me to make progress! Recently, I find workout is facinating and I like swimming, dancing, yoga and running even though my knees seems does not cooperate very well. Last but not the least, I like food. If you share the same hobbies with me, what are you waiting for? Let's be friends! :)
